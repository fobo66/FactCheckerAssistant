# Fact checking guide

_The claim is true when it's proven to be true. Sometimes claims are forged intentionally to mislead people. Or some claims can originate from poor education of cognitive biases that make people explain something with their assumptions and opinions, not facts. Some claims are specifically designed to trigger people, to catch their attention and urge them to spread it further. So it's important to detect such claims and be sceptical to all the info you can find in the internet to reduce potential harm caused by false claims. Here we have some actions that you can use to detect false claims, alongside with our app._

#### What creates solid proof?

Solid proof is traceable: you can find the origin of the claim easily and find any experiments that were used to prove the claim and their results. Also, the solid proof is most likely validated by the experts in the field, e.g. science articles are peer-reviewed before publication. It can happen that you can find a lot of the same false claim in different sources that are not interlinked with each other or don't have reference to the source. Lack of the reference to the source marks a false claim, most likely.

#### Keep calm

False claims tend to trigger emotions in the readers, so they will share it further in fear or anger without checking if the claim is actually true. It's usually done by using ALL CAPS text in a lot of places where it's unnecessary, blaming, hate speech, exaggeration. These tools are most certainly pointing to the false claim. Try to read the claim in doubt with calm and rational mind, and if you find some of the things mentioned above, the claim is most likely false. True claims don't use emotions to convince people, they use facts.

#### Don't share claim in concern further

The most negative effect of the false claims is that they tend to spread quickly, increasing negative impact on the society. If you stumble upon some page or post on social media, and you even slightly doubt its correctness, don't share it on your social media and don't send it to your contacts in messenger apps until you clarify the correctness of this claim.

#### Search for the title

Use Google search or our app to search the internet for the given claim. It will help you to find any proofs of the claim, as well as fact checks of other people. If you can find solid proofs for the claim, or fact-checking of other people showed that it's true, then the claim is most likely true. On the other hand, if there is not so much info about the claim in search or this info appears in unreliable sources, or fact-checking of other people showed that it's false, then the claim is most likely false. You can search for claim on special websites like [NewsGuard](https://www.newsguardtech.com/) or [PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/) that are explicitly specialized in checking news for correctness.

#### Check sources

Check the source for at least mentioning the claim. If the claim does not have any sources referenced, then it may be false. If the claim is going from the rumors, then you will need to ask authorities about it for official comment. If the source document does not have anything about the claim, then the claim is at least misleading, if not false. Also, some websites are known to produce false claims with little to no proofs, like InfoWars, so if given claim references one of these sites, it's probably false. Some claims can originate from satire websites, and that makes these claims false.

Sometimes authors of the claims are using forged data or misinterpretation of the data to present it as a proof for their claims. This is quite hard to check for regular users, so we suggest to refer to the fact checking agencies that are specialized in checking for just that

#### Check images

If you have an image as a proof to the claim, you can use image search to see if this image relates to the claim. Unrelated images are often used with some composed text to create false impressions. Image search can help you find the origin of the image, as well as the place of the photoshoot and related images. If the traced origin of the image does not relate to the given claim, then the claim is probably false.
